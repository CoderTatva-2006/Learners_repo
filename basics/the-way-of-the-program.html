</a><p>ThinkPython is a free Python book. Its first chapter is about
programming in general. <a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html">Read it
here.</a>.</p>
<p>Read the glossary also, but don't study it too much. Some things in it
are useful to know, but I think studying it carefully would be really
boring. Also do all exercises except the last one. It's more about
math skills than learning Python.</p>
<p>When you're done reading, read the summary below and make sure you've
learned everything.</p>
<a name="summary" href="#summary"><h2>Summary</h2>
</a><ul>
<li>Now you should have some kind of idea about what programming is.</li>
<li>Each value has a type, and you can find that out with <code>type(value)</code>.
  For example, writing <code>type(123)</code> to the Python prompt does the same
  thing as writing <code>int</code> to the prompt.</li>
<li>Types and classes are the same thing (in Python 3).</li>
<li>Some of the most commonly used types are:<ul>
<li>int is short for integer. <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> are integers.</li>
<li>float is short for floating point number. <code>1.0</code> and <code>3.14</code> are
  floats.</li>
<li>str is short for string. <code>"hello"</code> and <code>'hello'</code> are strings. It
  doesn't matter if you use 'single quotes' or "double quotes",
  they do the same thing in Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>What happens if you use + between two strings, like
 <code>"hello" + "world"</code>? How about <code>"hello" * "world"</code>?</li>
<li>What happens if you use + between a string and an integer, like
 <code>"hello" + 3</code>? How about <code>"hello" * 3</code>?</li>
<li>What happens if you use + between a float and an integer, like
 <code>0.5 + 3</code>? How about <code>0.5 * 3</code>?</li>
