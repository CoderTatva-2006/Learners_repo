    <a name="writing-a-larger-program" href="#writing-a-larger-program"><h1>Writing a larger program</h1>
</a><p>Now we know enough about Python for creating a program that is actually
useful. Awesome!</p>
<p>In this tutorial we'll write a program that reads questions and answers
in a text file and asks them. For example, this file would make the
program ask what "text displaying function" and "text asking function"
are:</p>
<pre><code>text displaying function = print
text asking function = input
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Save this example file to questions.txt</strong>, we'll need it later.</p>
<p>This might seem useless to you right now, but a program like this can
actually be really useful for learning different kinds of things. I
originally wrote a program like this to study words of a foreign
language, but then I realized that I could study pretty much anything
with it.</p>
<p>But there are many things the program needs to do and writing it seems
really difficult and complicated! How the heck can we do this?</p>
<a name="write-functions" href="#write-functions"><h2>Write functions</h2>
</a><p>Our program will need to do several different things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the questions from a file.</li>
<li>Ask the questions.</li>
<li>Print statistics about how many questions were answered correctly
and how many wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now everything seems much easier. We know how to do each of these steps
one by one, but doing it all at once would be difficult. In situations
like this it's important to <a href="defining-functions.html">define functions</a>.
We are going to write a <code>read_questions</code> function, an <code>ask_questions</code>
function and a <code>stats</code> function.</p>
<p>Let's start with the function that reads the question file:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span><span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">def</span> read_questions(filename):
    answers = {}
    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">with</span> <span style="color: #9966ff">open</span>(filename, <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;r&#39;</span>) <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">as</span> f:
        <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">for</span> line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">if</span> line != <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;&#39;</span>:
                question, answer = line.split(<span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;=&#39;</span>)
                answers[question.strip()] = answer.strip()
    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">return</span> answers
</pre></div>
<p>At this point it's best to try out the function to see how it works. You
need to create a <code>questions.txt</code> file like the one in the beginning of
this tutorial if you didn't create it already.</p>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Instructions for using the -i switch.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; read_questions(<span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;questions.txt&#39;</span>)
{&#39;text displaying function&#39;: &#39;print&#39;, &#39;text asking function&#39;: &#39;input&#39;}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>If your function doesn't work correctly it doesn't matter, and fixing
the problem is easy because the function is so short. This is one of the
reasons why we write functions.</p>
<p>Next we'll write the rest of the functions the same way, first writing
and then testing and fixing. Here are my versions of them:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span><span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">def</span> ask_questions(answers):
    correct = []
    wrong = []

    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">for</span> question, answer in answers.items():
        <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">if</span> <span style="color: #9966ff">input</span>(question + <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39; = &#39;</span>).strip() == answer:
            <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;Correct!&quot;</span>)
            correct.append(question)
        <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">else</span>:
            <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;Wrong! The correct answer is %s.&quot;</span> % answer)
            wrong.append(question)

    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">return</span> (correct, wrong)


<span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">def</span> stats(correct, wrong, answers):
    <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;\n**** STATS ****\n&quot;</span>)
    <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;You answered&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #9966ff">len</span>(correct), <span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;questions correctly and&quot;</span>,
          <span style="color: #9966ff">len</span>(wrong), <span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;questions wrong.&quot;</span>)

    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">if</span> wrong:
        <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;These would have been the correct answers:&quot;</span>)
        <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">for</span> question in wrong:
            <span style="color: #9966ff">print</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&#39; &#39;</span>, question, <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;=&#39;</span>, answers[question])
</pre></div>
<p>Note that these functions have some empty lines in them and there are
two empty lines between the functions. This makes the code a bit longer,
but it's a lot easier to read this way.</p>
<p>Let's try out the functions.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; answers = read_questions(<span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;questions.txt&#39;</span>)
&gt;&gt;&gt; correct, wrong = ask_questions(answers)
text displaying function = print
Correct!
text asking function = elif
Wrong! The correct answer is input.
&gt;&gt;&gt; correct
[&#39;text displaying function&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong
[&#39;text asking function&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; stats(correct, wrong, answers)

**** STATS ****

You answered 1 questions right and 1 questions wrong.
These would have been the correct answers:
  text asking function = input
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Everything is working! Now we just need something that runs everything
because we don't want to type this out on the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt every time.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the stats function printed <code>1 questions</code>
instead of <code>1 question</code>, and it looks a bit weird. You can modify the
<code>print_stats</code> function to fix this if you want to.</p>
<a name="the-main-function" href="#the-main-function"><h2>The main function</h2>
</a><p>The last function in a program like this is usually called <code>main</code> and it
runs the program using other functions. Our main function consists of
mostly the same pieces of code that we just tried out on the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>
prompt.</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span><span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">def</span> main():
    filename = <span style="color: #9966ff">input</span>(<span style="color: #ffff33">&quot;Name of the question file: &quot;</span>)
    answers = read_questions(filename)
    correct, wrong = ask_questions(answers)
    stats(correct, wrong, answers)
</pre></div>
<p>The last thing we need to add is these two lines:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span><span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">if</span> __name__ == <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;__main__&#39;</span>:
    main()
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>__name__</code> variable is set differently depending on how we run the
file, and it's <code>'__main__'</code> when we run the file directly instead of
importing. So if we run the file normally it asks us the words, and if
we import it instead we can still run the functions one by one. If you
want to know more about <code>__name__</code> just make a file that prints it and
run it in different ways.</p>
<p>Now the whole program looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight" style="background: #111111"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span></span><span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">def</span> read_questions(filename):
    answers = {}

        <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">for</span> line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">if</span> line != <span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;&#39;</span>:
                question, answer = line.split(<span style="color: #ffff33">&#39;=&#39;</span>)
                answers[question.strip()] = answer.strip()
    <span style="color: #6699cc; font-weight: bold">return</span> answers
