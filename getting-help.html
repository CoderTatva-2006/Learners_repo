</a><p>When you have a problem with Python, you're not alone! There are many
places to ask for help in.</p>
<a name="irc" href="#irc"><h2>IRC</h2>
</a><p>IRC is the oldest chatting service I know, but as of 2018, it's still
in use, and a great way to get help in Python. You don't need to
register anywhere, just click one of the links below and you're good to
go.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##learnpython">##learnpython</a> and
  <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/##python-friendly">##python-friendly</a>
  are beginner-friendly Python support channels. In my experience,
  people here tend to understand beginners' problems better, so you
  probably want to go to one of these.</li>
<li><a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/chat.freenode.net/#python">#python</a> is
  the official Python channel. If you have questions about advanced
  topics or you need help quickly, go there. However, this channel
  requires
  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-Nickname-on-Freenode">registering on freenode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make your question short. If you want to post a code example that is
more than two lines long, post it <a href="http://dpaste.com/">here</a> first.
Just copy-paste your code to the big text area and click the "Paste it"
button, and then post a link to your paste on IRC.</p>
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;you&gt;   i'm trying to check if this variable equals one but i keep
        getting an error http://dpaste.com/yourpaste
</code></pre>
<p>Don't do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;you&gt;   HEEEEELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
&lt;you&gt;     File "hello.py", line 3
&lt;you&gt;       if a = b:
&lt;you&gt;            ^
&lt;you&gt;   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<a name="websites-to-ask-help-on" href="#websites-to-ask-help-on"><h2>Websites to ask help on</h2>
</a><p>Personally, I've never asked a question on any of these sites. Getting
help on IRC is much faster.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> is a question/answer site
  for programmers. Search for your question first, maybe someone has
  already asked that and it has been answered.</li>
<li>At the time of writing this,
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/">the learnpython subreddit</a>
  is another good place to ask Python questions on.</li>
</ul>
