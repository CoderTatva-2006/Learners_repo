</a><p>If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.</p>
<p>You can experient with these things freely, but please <strong>don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.</strong> Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.</p>
