</a><p>This is a concise Python 3 programming tutorial for people who think
that reading is boring. I try to show everything with simple code
examples; there are no long and complicated explanations with fancy
words. If you have never programmed before click
<a href="basics/what-is-programming.html">here</a> to find out what programming is
like and get started.</p>
<p>This tutorial is aimed at people with no programming experience at all
or very little programming experience. If you have programmed a lot in
the past using some other language you may want to read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">the official
tutorial</a> instead.</p>
<p>You can use Python 3.5 or any newer Python with this tutorial. <strong>Don't
use Python 2 because it's no longer supported.</strong></p>
<a name="list-of-contents" href="#list-of-contents"><h2>List of contents</h2>
</a><p>The tutorial consists of two sections:</p>
<a name="basics" href="#basics"><h3>Basics</h3>
</a><p>This section will get you started with using Python and you'll be able
to learn more about whatever you want after studying it.</p>

<a name="advanced" href="#advanced"><h3>Advanced</h3>
</a><p>If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.</p>
<p>You can experiment with these things freely, but please <strong>don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.</strong> Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.</p>

<p>Go <a href="https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial">here</a> if you aren't here

</a><ol>
<li>Go <a href="https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial">here</a> if you aren't
 here already.</li>
<li><p>Click the big green "Clone or download" button in the top right of
 the page, then click "Download ZIP".</p>
<p><a href="images/download-me.png"><img src="images/download-me.png" alt="Download ZIP"></a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more
 specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on
 which operating system you run.</p>
</li>
<li>Run <code>make-html.py</code> and follow the instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the
repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage
with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole
tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to
pull with git and run <code>make-html.py</code> again.</p>
